Middle Management as a Service (MMaaS)

The defining characteristic of this system is to never offer anything concrete or actionable, only vague suggestions.

## Goals
Replace useless middle management with a series of small functions.

## Ideas

* Scan channel for question marks and reply with “we should have a wiki about that”.
* If you see lots of people posting one after another respond with “let’s put a pin in this and have a proper meeting” or “Let’s not design this in Slack”
* Anytime somebody responds to the manager directly, tag another person in the channel and ask them if they can “weigh in on this”.
